        <h1>14 Reasons You Should Row</h1>
        <p>Okay, so when I say there are 14 reasons you should be rowing, a couple of these are just reasons why you should be training your cardiovascular system as well as improving your strength. Speaking of which...</p>

        <h6>Rowing is a complete workout.</h6>
        <p>When you row, you get your heart rate up, you build your strength, and you improve endurance. More on that below.</p>
        
        <h6>You'll get tougher.</h6>
        <p>Often at the gym I'll see people hop on the erg for a minute or two before, out of breath and feeling very proud of themselves, moving on to something else. I'll help you get to the point where pulling for an hour, with perfect form, is routine (check out my articles for beginners, and when you're ready to enter the upper eschelons of fitness, <a href="ergelite.html">check out my course here</a>).</p>

        <h6>Low impact on your knees (and all your other joints).</h6>
        <p>When you run you are briefly in the air before landing with your full weight on one knee, over and over for however many miles you run. When you erg, you slide back and forth on your butt. As an anecdotal piece of evidence, one of the top rowers on the women's team when I was at university had converted from the swim team, because swimming had given her shoulder problems.<br><br>
        Brief aside: I'm not telling you to quit whatever you like to do, I'm pointing out how easy rowing is on your joints. Mix it up. I would go crazy if I only ever erged inside my house.</p>

        <h6>Effective aerobic workout.</h6>
        <p>You can get your heart rate up as high as you want, and suck down as much air as you can. Your heart will literally get bigger and stronger, and your whole cardiovascular system will get more efficient. Rowers consistently post insane VO2 max scores compared to other athletes.</p>

        <h6>You burn a ton of calories</h6>
        <p>There are a whole ton of aspects to weight gain and loss, but one significant piece is caloric intake vs calories burned. On one particularly strenuous (and frozen, otherwise we would have been on the water) Saturday morning, my heart rate monitor told me I had burned over 2000 calories after erging a total of 8 kilometers, broken into 500 meter sprint spieces.</p>

        <h6>Build lean muscle mass</h6>
        <p>Go look up what Olympic rowers look like. Notice how they don't look like Arnold in Pumping Iron? They're stronger.<br><br>
        Okay they probably can't bench as much as Arnold, but they are for sure stronger in their lower half and posterior chain, which leads us to</p>

        <h6>Improved posture</h6>
        <p>Stability and strength in your core and posterior chain allow you to maintain better posture throughout the day. Strengthening your upper back will combat the tight chest and rounded shoulders/neck due to the modern sedentary lifestyle.</p>

        <h6>Improved upper, lower body strength, core strength</h6>
        <p>I've kind of already said this, but it deserves its own attention. Pulling the erg handle against the flywheel's resistance is hard, and when you do that a lot you get really strong. More importantly, you gain strength endurance, which is almost always more useful than having the 1 rep max of a power lifter (obviously I still recommend getting in the gym and lifting shit occasionally).<br><br>
        Just to be explicit, when you first start rowing you'll probably tire quickest in your core and low back, maybe your shoulders as well. Once you develop the stabilizing strength to be able to maintain form, you'll be able to really work your big muscles (hammies, quads, glutes, traps, lats, etc).</p>

        <h6>Not complicated</h6>
        <p>You sit, you pull, you acquire gains. Check out my article on perfect tech so you move efficiently and don't injure yourself <a href="articles/perfect-tech.html">here</a>.</p>

        <h6>Affordable</h6>
        <p>If you already have a gym membership then you almost certainly already have access to an erg. If not, a new concept 2 stationary erg (please don't buy the dynamic one if you don't already know how to row on the water) will cost you about $900 and last you for the rest of your life. I got mine lightly used for $600. Doesn't hurt to ask your local rowing club what it would cost you to take one of theirs off their hands.</p>

        <h6>Convenient</h6>
        <p>Again, there's a 95% chance the gym you go to already has an erg for you to use. Or buy one for yourself and it's in your house, can't really get more convenient than that. Also they tuck away neatly.</p>

        <h6>Low risk</h6>
        <p>In a similar vein to the low impact, it's just about impossible to injure yourself (note: it won't be my fault if you miraculously figure out how to accomplish that though). You won't twist your ankle or drop any weights on yourself.</p>

        <h6>Good warm up (for a lift or whatever)</h6>
        <p>Some light rowing before another form of training will get your whole body primed and physically warm (some research says literally warming yourself is the most important part about warming up), which will help prevent injury.</p>

        <h6>Good for every aspect of your health</h6>
        <p>Okay so clearly not exclusive to rowing, but exercise has been proven to be the second best thing in the universe you can do to improve everything about your physical, mental, emotional, financial health. Second best only after quitting smoking. Also the financial health comment wasn't a joke; healthcare here in the US is expensive, and keeping your heart and the rest of you in good shape keeps you out of preventable trips to the doctor.</p>
