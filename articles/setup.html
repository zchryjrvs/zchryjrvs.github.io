        <p>Move the damper off of 10. This isn't optional. When you pull on the handle you spin the flywheel, meaning as you pull harder the handle gets harder to pull. Setting the damper to the max doesn't make your workout harder, pulling harder makes your workout harder. Put it somewhere between 3 and 5. If you want to be consistent with drag across machines, pick a drag factor in the 100 - 120 area, and if you don't know what that means, <a href="c2-monitor.html">read my article on navigating the Concept2 monitor here.</a></p>
